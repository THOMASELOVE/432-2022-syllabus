# One More Thing

Once you have read through to this point in the Syllabus, please visit Piazza and create a public note in the syllabus folder. There, you should upload for Professor Love an image from one of your favorite television programs, along with the name of the program, and a sentence or two about why you enjoy (or have enjoyed) that program. 

- If you'd prefer to share a serial program from a streaming service, that is also fine. What we're looking for is something we can watch that has multiple episodes. We intend to share the list of selected programs with the class, not identifying which student liked which program.

If you post this information before the start of Class 03, Dr. Love will add some bonus credit to your class participation grade, and he will also be very grateful, but if you don't see this until after that time, please do create a note and post it anyway.

Thank you.
