Life is not OK right now. None of us are really okay. Were all just pretending. You most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased care responsibilities - you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you might be facing uncertain job prospects. Im fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your labs, do well on your quizzes and projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am fairly flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified. If you tell me youre having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope youll extend me the same grace. You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that youre going through, though. If I cant help you myself, I may know somebody who can. If you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like youre behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to us! We will work with you. I promise. I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis. Thanks to Andrew Heiss for a lot of the better words here. 1.1 In case of emergency What if my situation changes (for any reason) during the semester? If you need to miss one session, or even two, just review the materials (including the recordings) and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help. If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of a lab, a project or a quiz, send an email directly to Dr. Love saying the following: I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (list things youre worried about completing) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans. Dr. Love will respond with OK and temporarily excuse you from things until you send a re-connection email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time hell evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency.

The course Github repository at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2022 and several related repositories such as https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data. You will also want to get yourself a (free) Github account at https://github.com/join so you can establish a presence online. The RStudio Community at https://community.rstudio.com/ has been very helpful in the past to some students. You may want to establish an account there, too, to link yourself to the broader community of RStudio users, but this is optional. "],["course-description.html", "Section 3 Course Description 3.1 General Approach / Topics 3.2 Prerequisites 3.3 Everything is on the Web", " Section 3 Course Description PQHS 432 (cross-listed as CRSP 432 and MPHP 432, and formerly known as EPBI 432) is the second half of a two-semester sequence (with PQHS 431) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent (as little theory as possible), emphasizing the key role of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research. The title listed by the registrar is a little dated - I prefer Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research. This is a good course for people who want to learn how to use the R language to get information from data, and who want to learn about making comparisons and building models to help make meaningful progress in research, focusing on questions from biology, medicine and public health. We spend time managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other things thought of as data science - in essence, this highly applied course focuses on modern, more than classical, tools for learning from data. The course is taught using the R statistical software and RStudio environments, with the material discussed in 431 assumed in 432. Students learned a lot of R in the 431 course, and that material remains available at https://thomaselove.github.io/431/ until 2022-06-01. Well continue to use R Studio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform our research in replicable ways. 3.1 General Approach / Topics The course covers the following general topics, roughly in this order, through early April. Additional topics (for the remainder of April) will be determined later in the semester. Dealing with interaction and other forms of non-linearity in regression models by spending degrees of freedom on non-linear terms, particularly through the Harrell verse. Using regression methods for different purposes (exploring associations, making predictions, assessing cause and effect). Logistic regression and generalized linear models for binary, count and multi-categorical outcomes. Using tidymodels approaches to build models in a more automated, tidier way, and to use more modern (robust and/or Bayesian) regression fitting strategies. Variable selection and its woeful performance in real situations. The statistical crisis in science, and how though statistical significance and p values are especially problematic, science isnt broken. Retrospective assessments and issues related to sample size, especially post hoc power estimates. Dealing with time-to-event (survival) data, with an introduction to censoring, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models. Using sampling weights to mirror populations in modeling results (NHANES being a prime example). An introduction to dealing with hierarchical data, especially when confronted with repeated measures. Doing replicable research, and how to be a modern scientist with a web presence. Within the realm of modeling, our linear regression work will include discussions of weighted and robust approaches, variable selection, dealing with missing data, fitting non-linear relationships through predictor transformation, cross-validation approaches, and multi-factor ANOVA and ANCOVA. In terms of logistic regression, well encounter models for binary outcomes, for proportions, and for risk adjustment. Well also touch on models for count data and multi-categorical outcomes. 3.2 Prerequisites Taking 432 without 431 is not recommended. The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, in any field of study. The main things students need for 432 are: tools: substantive knowledge of the use of R, R Studio and R Markdown to produce code which will ingest, visualize, explore, analyze and model data, then communicate the results statistical methodology: substantive understanding of statistical inference in the one-, two- and multi-sample cases and the fundamentals of linear regression models, including the building of multiple linear regressions, and their evaluation through diagnostic plots, stepwise model selection, assessment of uncertainty via confidence and prediction intervals, and basic in-sample and out-of sample validation summaries data to study related to biological, health, medical, scientific or other phenomena, and an interest in studying data closely and presenting rigorous analyses effectively Some of these topics are reviewed in early 432 sessions. 3.3 Everything is on the Web https://thomaselove.github.io/432/ is the place to go for everything related to this course. Please visit any time you need something. I update the web site frequently. The most important thing is the Course Calendar which serves as the final word for all deadlines, plus links to all classes and deliverables. Dr. Loves course notes will serve as the principal textbook for the course, and will appear during the semester. The current version is available now. Dr. Love will likely update it during the semester.

Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of frustration (even if youve been doing this stuff for years!). You shouldnt spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help. Once the course begins, you have several ways to get help from us: 4.1 TA Office hours provide one-on-one help We have eight dedicated and capable Teaching Assistants working with us this term. More information on the TAs is available here. You are strongly encouraged to visit the Teaching Assistants during office hours that are convenient for you, whenever you need help with the course. This is the best way to get one-on-one help, or try out a new idea. TA office hours will be held exclusively via zoom. They begin on Wednesday 2022-01-19 and continue through Sunday 2022-04-24, other than during Spring Break. Zoom information to join these sessions will be found on Canvas, and on our Shared Google Drive. The weekly schedule of TA office hours follows: Date Time(s) Sunday 9:30 - 10:30 AM, 5:30 - 7:00 PM, 8:30 - 10:00 PM Monday 5:00 - 6:30 PM, 7:00 - 8:30 PM Wednesday Noon - 1:30 PM Thursday 6:00 - 7:30 PM Friday Noon - 1:00 PM Saturday 10:30 AM - Noon, 3:30 - 5:00 PM Remember that Piazza is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for your questions and answers. Office Hours are held for your benefit. Please visit the TAs, especially if you have questions about how to do things in R, or about the content of the class slides or course notes. Theyre volunteering their time to help you, and most of them have been in your shoes in previous years. They want to help you! More information on the TAs is posted below. 4.2 Piazza is the place to ask questions 24/7 We will use Piazza this semester to facilitate questions and answers. Well conduct all class-related discussion there, rather than via email. Find our class page at: https://piazza.com/case/spring2022/pqhs432. If youre successfully enrolled in the class, you should be able to sign up immediately. The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker youll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when youre struggling to understand anything related to the class, and you can even do so anonymously. Youll also be able to help your colleagues by answering their questions, as well. We will use Piazza for all questions except questions about Quizzes. Information about getting help on the Quizzes will be provided as part of the instructions for each Quiz. In addition, there are many, many online resources to help you learn R beyond those we provide. Googling effectively is an important skill that requires practice. Dont be afraid to use search engines to figure out how to code things in R, for example. The RStudio Community is a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (and that will be you.) 4.3 Meeting with Professor Love Professor Love does not hold regular office hours. He will open Zoom 10 minutes before each class, and keep it open afterwards, as well, to address any concerns that youre willing to discuss there. If you have any unique concerns about the course, need special accommodations or have any other issues you want to discuss with Professor Love specifically, please email him (Thomas dot Love at case dot edu) and hell respond as quickly as possible. Questions about course materials are best asked through Piazza or at TA Office Hours.

Chief Data Scientist, Better Health Partnership Track Lead for Health Care Analytics, MS in Biostatistics, Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, CWRU Fellow, American Statistical Association 5.1 A More Complete Biography Hi. I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs. I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics. I direct Biostatistics and Data Science at the Population Health Research Institute and at the Center for Health Care Research and Policy at The MetroHealth System. For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for Better Health Partnership, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I still consult occasionally with them and hold the position of Chief Data Scientist there. I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching from CWRU. I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management. In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records. You may be interested in a study in Health Affairs showing the impact of a Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland. Or you might be interested in our New England Journal of Medicine study of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes. In 2011, James OMalley and I chaired the Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics, here in Cleveland. Heres a recap. Ive also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure. If you want to see a pretty complete list of my publications, knock yourself out. I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at Savant Systems, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder has graduated college and works and lives in Pittsburgh, and the younger is in his sophomore year at Columbia University. We live in Shaker Heights. I sing and act occasionally in community theater, and do lots of puzzles and play golf when I can. 5.2 Email Thomas dot Love at case dot edu (for matters related to grades or individual concerns) Professor Love is available before and (especially) after class to chat. Remember we have several ways for you to get help with the course. 5.3 Name and Pronouns Professor Love uses he/him/his pronouns. Most students refer to him either as Professor Love or Dr. Love. He prefers his given name to be written Thomas as opposed to Tom. Most of his friends and colleagues call him Tom.

The materials from the 431 course this past Fall will remain available at https://thomaselove.github.io/431/ until 2022-06-01. 9.1 Getting the Software Instructions are available at https://thomaselove.github.io/432/ in the R and Data section on the top menu. Everything is free, but it does require some patience to get control over your computer. You will need to: Download and install/update to the latest version of R (version 4.1.2. or later) Download and install/update to the latest version of RStudio (version 2021.09.1+372 or later) Install some R packages Download 432 data and code developed for this course Obtain a free Github user account if you dont have one already. 9.2 From the 431 Syllabus The remainder of this chapter comes from the 431 syllabus, and lays out some of the fundamental ideas and bits of encouragement I built for those folks this past Fall, and most of this is still relevant now. The course makes heavy use of the R statistical programming language, and several related tools, most especially the RStudio development environment. Every bit of this software is free to use, and open-source. You will need access to a computer to do your work for this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course. There will be many people in the course for whom R is a new experience. I assume no prior R work in the course. You will know a fair amount of R (and some other things, too) after taking the course, though. Well also be using the R Markdown tool within RStudio. R Markdown will be taught in our class, and can be used to generate reproducible reports that appear as .html files, PDF files or Word documents, among other things. For some people, working with R is the best part of the class, and the part that theyre most excited about. For others, its a real source of anxiety. We understand and encourage patience. There will definitely be some pain, but our experience is that things are much smoother for most people by the middle of the term than they appear to be at the start. 9.3 R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard. R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. Learning R can be difficult at first - its like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham-the chief scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages youll be using like ggplot2 made this wise observation: Its easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, Oh its me, Im really stupid, or, Im not made out to program. But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. Its just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Dont blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. If youre finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to the teaching assistants, post questions on Piazza, etc. I promise you can do this. Some of this material is also borrowed from Andrew Heiss, for instance, from here and here. 9.4 System Requirements You will need access to a computer to do your work for this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. Whether or not you want to bring that computer to class is up to you. All of the software we will use in this class is either free and open source, or available to you for free through your affiliation with CWRU, so there is nothing to buy in terms of software. Weve made some effort in terms of course requirements to set the bar low. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course. You will need a computer, either PC (running Windows 10 would be helpful) or Macintosh (running a reasonably recent OS), but your choice should be determined by your personal preferences and how you believe you will use the machine in your research life. RStudio and R will look and work the same on either a PC or a Macintosh. We do not recommend the use of a Chromebook for this class. R and RStudio Desktop also run on Linux systems but Dr. Love knows essentially nothing about that. Consult the documentation at CRAN for R and at the download page for RStudio. 9.5 Why do we teach R, instead of SPSS or SAS or whatever, in 431-432? Because it is by far the better choice for what were trying to do, which is to help you become effective data scientists. And effective scientists, period. Because being a data scientist means writing code and actually doing (not just talking about) replicable research, which R facilitates in an immense variety of ways. Because R is free to you, me and everyone, and its community is a daily delight. To read comments from other people on the subject, I suggest reading Why R? from Chester Ismay and Patrick Kennedy. Also, the question of Why R and not SPSS? was nicely addressed by Greg Snow in this 2010 post at StackOverflow When talking about user friendliness of computer software I like the analogy of cars vs. busses: Busses are very easy to use, you just need to know which bus to get on, where to get on, and where to get off (and you need to pay your fare). Cars on the other hand require much more work, you need to have some type of map or directions (even if the map is in your head), you need to put gas in every now and then, you need to know the rules of the road (have some type of drivers licence). The big advantage of the car is that it can take you a bunch of places that the bus does not go and it is quicker for some trips that would require transfering between busses. Using this analogy programs like SPSS are busses, easy to use for the standard things, but very frustrating if you want to do something that is not already preprogrammed. R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a kayak on top, good walking and running shoes in the passenger seat, and mountain climbing and spelunking gear in the back. R can take you anywhere you want to go if you take time to learn how to use the equipment, but that is going to take longer than learning where the bus stops are in SPSS. 9.6 Getting Started With R, RStudio and Tidy Statistics If youre interested in getting started with the tools youll be using before the class gets rolling, the great folks at RStudio Education provide these 6 ways to begin learning R. Pick the one that appeals to you, and give it a shot. Note that if youre having trouble installing things, you can still learn a lot about R, RStudio and Data Science basics with the interactive tutorials at https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers. If youre already a strong coder, and have some R experience, there are also learning pathways for intermediates at RStudio Education which might be appealing to you. You can do this, and well be there to help you. 9.7 For those of you worried about coding, software, or R There will be many people in the course for whom R is a new experience. I assume no prior R work in the course. You will know a fair amount of R (and some other things, too) after taking the course, though. Well also be using the R Markdown tool within RStudio. R Markdown will be taught in our class, and can be used to generate reproducible reports that appear as .html files, PDF files or Word documents, among other things. For some people, working with R is the best part of the class, and the part that theyre most excited about. For others, its a real source of anxiety. We understand and encourage patience. There are many, many online resources to help you with working in R, and well point you to many of the best of them during the semester. For now, we suggest those listed above in the Getting Started with R section. "],["assignments-and-grading.html", "Section 10 Assignments and Grading 10.1 Timing and Deadlines 10.2 Minute Papers (and Class Participation) 10.3 Labs 10.4 Appeal Policy and Regrades 10.5 Quizzes 10.6 Projects 10.7 Final Grade", " Section 10 Assignments and Grading Course assignments include (in increasing order of the time you will spend): Ten minute papers (along with other elements of class participation) Six labs Two quizzes, and Two projects The course website links to detailed and specific descriptions regarding each of these deliverables. This syllabus material describes each in general terms, and provides some guidance on logistics, expectations and grading. 10.1 Timing and Deadlines The Calendar is the exclusive home for all deadlines in the course. Dr. Love will always go there to figure out when something is due, and if a change is made, it isnt official until it appears on the Calendar. 10.2 Minute Papers (and Class Participation) During the semester, there are ten Minute Papers scheduled. In this class, a Minute Paper is a short survey (completed using a Google Form) where you will answer a few questions about how the course is going for you. To complete the Minute Paper, youll need to log into Google with your CWRU account. The pre-class Welcome to 432 survey uses a similar format, but is more extensive than a typical Minute Paper. Each Minute Paper should take no more than ten minutes to complete, and is best done right at the end of Tuesdays class. The Minute Papers are due at noon Wednesday to give you some time to reflect, if youd like, or if youre in a hurry at the end of Tuesdays class. You should complete the Minute Paper even if you havent attended the most recent class. 10.2.1 Participation We cannot emphasize enough how much we want to hear from you about things that are relevant to this course. If youre not shy, ask questions in the Chat during class. Come to the (virtual) TA office hours if you need help. Contribute to Piazza with questions, answers and helpful comments. Thatll help us recognize you as someone trying to improve their understanding. If you find typos in the materials (code, slides, the Notes, this syllabus) send them to us on Piazza. See a cool visualization online? A nice use of statistical methods or design in a paper? Share them with us on Piazza. Email Dr. Love if you want to discuss something that doesnt fit on Piazza or in a conversation with a TA. Visit with him before or after class. Make an appointment to talk with him if you have something to discuss that doesnt work well in email. Its always helpful if Dr. Love knows who you are, and this is an especially difficult thing to achieve remotely. 10.3 Labs During the semester, there are six lab assignments scheduled. Professor Love reserves the right to change the number of labs (or to create optional bonus labs) depending on how the class is going during the semester. Most require straightforward demonstrations of mastery for core principles and fundamental skills. Some require deeper dives into more technically sophisticated material. Most labs ask you to clean/visualize/analyze some data that we provide to you, and also to react to something were reading at the same time in the Silver or Leek books. You should anticipate that some coding in R and writing at least one essay will be required in most labs. Each lab includes instructions as to how to make your submission, usually through Canvas. The courses primary listing on Canvas is PQHS 432, but students in CRSP 432 and MPHP 432 should find the same information. The link to post your responses for each Lab will appear in time for you to submit the work, usually just after the deadline for the preceding Lab has passed. Each lab is associated with a deadline. Late work is permitted, but penalized (see the Grading section below.) 10.3.1 A few tips for Early Lab Work When writing anything for this course in English, use complete sentences, not just bullet points. Clearly mark each Question in each Lab. There is no need to repeat the question before answering it, although you are welcome to do so. You are welcome to discuss each Lab with anyone, including Professor Love, the teaching assistants, or your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. We especially encourage you to take advantage of TA office hours and Piazza. In general, we do not guarantee to provide answers to questions on Piazza that we receive in the last 12 hours before a Lab is due, although we will continue to hold TA office hours up to the deadline. Try not to leave things until the last day. Allow time for computer problems. More information (and links to the actual Lab assignments) will be found on our main course web site. 10.3.2 Grading Labs Labs are graded by the Teaching Assistants, according to a rubric and answer sketch, developed by the instructional staff for the course, including Dr. Love. Everything counts, including the quality of the presentation, as well as the coding and statistical work. For each Lab, we publish a detailed answer sketch (typically at noon on the day after the deadline). By the time grades become available (roughly one week after the deadline) you will also receive the grading rubric, though we sometimes include this with the sketch. Along with the grade, on-time labs will receive modest feedback about the work. The required labs are each due on Mondays at 9 PM Eastern time. See the Calendar for all deadlines. 10.4 Appeal Policy and Regrades Clarification of concerns related to potential typographical or other errors in our Lab answer sketches is welcome at any time, but haggling over points on assignments can be a real time sink in a large class. To that end, students are requested not to dispute any grading on Labs during the semester. Should you receive a lower grade on a Lab than you feel you deserve based on the feedback the TA provides, the answer sketch and the grading rubric, you can simply submit a request for a regrade by Professor Love through the Google Form which (once Lab 1 is graded) will be found at http://bit.ly/432-2022-lab-regrade-requests. You must log into Google via CWRU to see the form. In May, after Professor Love has worked out what letter grade to give each student, he will go through the requests on the form and determine for each whether the students letter grade would change if all of the points in dispute were granted. If the answer is no, then he wont even look at the disputed grade(s). If the answer is yes, then he will look very carefully to see if enough extra points are merited to change a grade. (It will not help your case to submit frivolous requests.) On the course Labs page, we will include a section about Grading Errors and Regrade Requests repeating this information. If you wish to dispute a grade, fill out the form at any time before the deadline in May. You can edit the form after submitting it so that you can add additional requests up until the end of the semester. All forms must be submitted by the deadline on the Course Calendar. Professor Love is responsible for all final grading decisions, and if you have a concern, you should submit your request through the form. The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term. - The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Loves attention via email, and he will resolve it immediately. The main advantage of this system is that it saves all of us the hassle of haggling over points that are never going to mean anything anyway. It also provides equal access to students who are too timid to express their concerns. Finally, if there is an issue with grading a particular problem or assignment that needs to be reconsidered, Professor Love will have access to all papers and can make a universal decision. Incidentally, this idea comes from Jessica Utts at http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v22n2/rossmanint.pdf. 10.5 Quizzes During the semester, you will have two quizzes to complete. Each quiz is taken online via a Google Form (like the Minute Papers or the Welcome to 432 survey.) Each quiz includes both short-answer and multiple-choice items. The quizzes focus on whether you can apply the tools developed in class to address small problems. Each quiz will be designed to take about 6 hours to complete, so the time pressure should be minimal. If you need to make alternate arrangements for a Quiz, please contact Professor Love via email as soon as possible, at least a week before a Quiz is released. 10.5.1 Piazza and the Quizzes As weve discussed, for most of the course, Piazza will be our tool for asking and answering questions. However, for questions about the Quizzes, we will provide an alternate method for you to ask questions of Dr. Love and the Teaching Assistants, and we will share that approach at the top of each Quiz as they become available. 10.5.2 About the Quizzes Quizzes typically involve 20-30 questions. The questions are not arranged in any particular order, and you should answer all questions. All questions involve relatively short responses, sometimes after working through a detailed analysis. You will have the opportunity to edit your responses after completing the Quiz, but this must be completed by the deadline. You are welcome (even encouraged) to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on the Quizzes with anyone other than Professor Love or the teaching assistants. We do not guarantee to answer questions we receive about the Quiz less than 3 hours prior to the Quiz submission deadline. As noted above, we will not use Piazza for Quiz questions, but instead an alternate approach we will provide to you with each quiz. Quizzes that are more than an hour late will not be accepted, except in truly remarkable circumstances. An answer sketch for each Quiz will be made available within 48 hours of the deadline. Grades for the Quizzes are usually available within 48 hours of the deadline. If you feel Professor Love has made an error in grading your Quiz, please let him know directly, by email, as soon as possible. For more information on the Quizzes, please visit our main course web site. 10.6 Projects During the semester, you will have two projects to complete. Project A anticipates you using materials from the first 12 classes. Project B anticipates you using materials from the first 25 classes. For more information on the Projects, please visit our main course web site. 10.7 Final Grade Over the past five years, all students taking the course have eventually earned either an A, a B or an Incomplete in 432. I dont see a reason why this wont also be the case this year. Grading standards apply in the same way for all students, regardless of whether they are enrolled in PQHS 432, CRSP 432 or MPHP 432. The courses are identical. The course grade is based on four key areas of demonstrated accomplishment. Course grades are based primarily on performance on labs, projects and quizzes. Your grade on each of these three elements will be determined separately, using a process I will describe in a later version of the Syllabus, to be posted soon. Then I will combine these elements as follows: Element Weight 1 Weight 2 Weight 3 Weight 4 Labs 35% 30% 25% - Projects 45% 40% 35% - Quizzes 25% 20% 15% - Participation - - - 10% Among Labs, Projects and Quizzes, your element with the strongest score will receive Weight 1, your element with the second strongest score will receive Weight 2 and your element with the weakest score will receive weight 3. The Class Participation score is worth 10% for all students. I will determine your final course grade using the following scale: course averages of 89% to 100% will receive a A course averages of 85% to 88% will be reviewed more closely to determine whether the grade will be A or B course averages of 70% to 84% will receive a B For students in the 85-88% range, students who have improved from the first half of the course to the second will be more likely to receive an A than those whose performance has declined. Students whose course average is near or below 70% will usually need to take an Incomplete to improve their work before I assign a final grade. "],["course-policies.html", "Section 11 Course Policies 11.1 Emergency Policy 11.2 Regrade Policy 11.3 Other Course Policies 11.4 Frequently Asked Questions", " Section 11 Course Policies 11.1 Emergency Policy If you need to miss one session, or even two, just review the materials (including the recordings) and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help. If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of a lab, a project or a quiz, send an email directly to Dr. Love saying the following: I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (list things youre worried about completing) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans. Dr. Love will respond with OK and temporarily excuse you from things until you send a re-connection email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time hell evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency. 11.2 Regrade Policy Grades on projects and quizzes are completed by Dr. Love. For labs, TAs do all grading. Students are requested not to dispute any grading on Labs during the semester. Instead, should you receive a lower grade on a Lab than you feel you deserve based on the feedback the TA provides, the answer sketch and the grading rubric, you should submit a request for a regrade by Professor Love through the Google Form found at http://bit.ly/432-2022-lab-regrade-requests. You must log into Google via CWRU to see the form. 11.3 Other Course Policies Any concerns or questions regarding these general policies, the teaching assistants or the course itself should be directed to Professor Love, if at all possible. All student work is subject to the Universitys policies and procedures. Registration is required. I do not permit anyone to audit the course who has not previously taken it, without exception. If youve taken the course before and want to sit in again, you will need to volunteer or be hired as a teaching assistant. Grading. Students in this class are not in competition with each other for grades. I have no set percentage of students who will receive any particular grade. Attendance is expected, but it is also expected that sometimes life will intervene. All students are expected to attend all class sessions, but if necessary, using the video recordings made available on Canvas to view each class before the next one is given. If you need to miss two or more classes in a row, inform Professor Love via email beforehand, or as soon as possible thereafter. I will assume you have a good reason - details are not necessary. You are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for your absence. Submissions In this class, it is far better to turn in timely, but only partially complete work than nothing at all. Feedback on assignments - deadline. On every assignment, Lab, Quiz, project-related task, whatever, we will be delighted to respond to questions up to 12 hours before the assignment is due. After that time, you may wind up on your own. The reason for this is that Professor Love and the teaching assistants will regularly post responses to frequently asked questions about assignments, and we need sufficient time to accomplish this task. On Getting Help Quickly and Effectively: In general, we dont have a way to diagnose your problem with R, RStudio or Markdown if you dont show us what youre typing that causes an error, or a lack of results. If you wrote a Markdown file, we need to see it, along with a specific question (or series of them) about specific error messages or strange results you are getting. We need to replicate the problem in order to know how to fix your problem, and it also helps if we know what error message youre seeing, or what strange result you are getting. Distractions. Please mute yourself during a Zoom class, unless you are asking a question, or working in a small group. We strongly prefer people to turn on their cameras, but do not require this. The temptation to look at your phone or Facebook or email during class is nearly irresistible. Resist anyway, if only to avoid distracting your instructor and your fellow students. Research Usage. Any and all results of in-class and out-of-class assignments and activities are data sources for research and may be used in published research. All such use will always be anonymous. Recording. We intend to provide video recordings of each class after they are complete. You should assume that anything you say or place in the Chat session during a Zoom class session will be recorded. Typos. Professor Love makes occasional typographic and grammatical errors, which irritate him enormously. Please post in the relevant section of Piazza if you find any in this syllabus or any other course materials. If you are the first to let us know, and we make the change, you will receive some credit in your class participation grade. Again, all Case Western Reserve University policies apply to this class. To the extent that those policies are unclear, I would regard an appropriate code of conduct as mirroring this one from the R Consortium. 11.4 Frequently Asked Questions 11.4.1 Can I audit the course? No. Enrolled students and teaching assistants are the only people permitted to attend the course. 11.4.2 Is it possible to take the course pass/fail? No, it is not. However, no student in the past five years has received a final course grade other than A, B or Incomplete. 11.4.3 How will I know how Im doing in the class? We aim for substantial and timely feedback from the teaching assistants and myself on all elements of the course. 11.4.4 Does the 432 course assume we have completed 431? Yes, it does. The materials from the 431 course are available to you until 2022-06-01 at https://thomaselove.github.io/431/. 11.4.5 Do I have to be in Cleveland to take this course? Yes. We hope that only the first four classes will be done via Zoom. 11.4.6 Will all class materials be available to me online? Well try to make sure all sessions are video-recorded and made available to you after class, but weve had technical problems more than once in the past with that strategy, so we wont promise that will happen. All slides and many other materials will definitely be provided through the README for each class. 11.4.7 How do I get connected to Zoom through CWRU? The Zoom links for the semesters classes are available now through Canvas, and have also been emailed to your CWRU account if you are enrolled through SIS. 11.4.8 What if I lose my internet connection during a Zoom class? Thats part of the reason why each session will be recorded. If Dr. Love loses his, well pause until things get straightened out.

Heres what I find to be a compelling argument from George Cobb  If you want your work with data to make a difference, devote time and effort to choosing the words and pictures you use to present your evidence and conclusions. If you teach or supervise, seek to reward those - they who learn from you, and they who report to you  when they spend time crafting their message. Think back to the last report you were expected to read. Is it easy to recall the main points? The answer, yes or no, depends not so much on the quality of the data, the effort, and the thinking that went into the report, nor on your own dutiful diligence in reading the report, but rather, and mainly, on whether the people who wrote the report had learned and practiced the skills of how to use words and pictures, first, to claim attention, and second, to claim retention: to deliver a message that sticks in the mind. 13.1 Campus Resources The University Resources for Student Support section in this Syllabus lists several important resources for improving your English and your communication skills, most of which will be available remotely after the first week of the semester. We strongly encourage you to take advantage of these resources. 13.2 Advice from Other People Preparing Manuscripts for Submission to Medical Journals: The Paper Trail by H. Gilbert Welch, from Effective Clinical Practice in 1999. Start early, focus on high-visibility components, develop a systematic approach to the body of the paper, finish strong.

Frank Harrells Checklist for Authors of Statistical Problems to Document and to Avoid 13.3 A Few Tips from Professor Love Statistics is a getting the details right business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7. Nothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables. Dont parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism. Edit your more adventurous output; dont present everything you know how to do in R, and dont forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results. Make your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary. Clearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate. Simplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well. Data are plural. Use the data are  rather than ``the data is   A paragraph must contain more than one sentence. Dont switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout. Dont write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result. Similarly, dont defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in. If you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval. If you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a p-value, then you should state something like: [1] Were using a 95% confidence level. [2] Were using a 5% significance level. [3] Were using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Dont use more than one of these expressions. Again, dont use p-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p = 1\\). To the extent possible, dont use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things  do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage. When in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking, clear writing.

There, you should upload for Professor Love an image from one of your favorite television programs, along with the name of the program, and a sentence or two about why you enjoy (or have enjoyed) that program. If youd prefer to share a serial program from a streaming service, that is also fine. What were looking for is something we can watch that has multiple episodes. We intend to share the list of selected programs with the class, not identifying which student liked which program. If you post this information before the start of Class 03, Dr. Love will add some bonus credit to your class participation grade, and he will also be very grateful, but if you dont see this until after that time, please do create a note and post it anyway.
